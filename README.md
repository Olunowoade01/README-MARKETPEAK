# MarketPeak_Ecommerce




The goal of this project is to create an e-commerce website for an online marketplace, featuring product listings, a shopping cart, and user authentication.

> I created a folder for the MarketPeak_Ecommerce project using the mkdir command.

## step 1

![create a folder](./img/1.git%20mkdir%20and%20git%20init.png)

## Step 2

> I downloaded a website template from the recommended source, then staged and committed it to the Git repository.

Using the commands:
git add .
git config
git commit

![stage and commit](./img/2.%20git%20add%20config%20and%20commit.png)


## Step 3 

> After initializing the Git repository and adding the website template, I pushed the code to a remote repository on GitHub. I created the repository without including a README or .gitignore file.

Using the command:
`git remote add origin`

# Step 4 

 > In Step 4, I connected my EC2 keypair to the terminal. To do this, I navigated to the directory where the keypair was stored.

Using the cd command:
cd ~/path/to/keypair

 ![file ](./img/4.cd%20download%20to%20find%20the%20file.png)


 ## Step 5 

 > In Step 5, I cloned the repository to my Linux server and set the correct permissions for the keypair.

Using the following commands:
ssh-keygen
ssh -i keypair server-ip

![give permision](./img/5.give%20permision%20and%20execute.png)


## step 6 

> In Step 6, I added my EC2 public SSH key to my GitHub account.


![git code](./img/6.%20git%20code%20.png)


## Step 7 

> In Step 7, I generated the SSH URL to clone the repository.




![generate ssh keypair](./img/07.%20generate%20ssh%20keypair.png)



## Step 8 

> This process shows the SSH public key pair that I used to clone the repository on my EC2 server.





![display and copy publick key](./img/8.display%20and%20copy%20publick%20key.png)




## Step 9

> This process shows the SSH public key pair that I used to clone the repository on my EC2 server.




![sshkey](./img/9.%20mysshkey.png)



## Step 10 

> This step shows the error I encountered while trying to clone the GitHub repository on my EC2 server using SSH.


![error](./img/10.Error.png)



## Step 11 

> After adding my SSH public key to GitHub, I successfully cloned the repository to my EC2 server using the git clone command.


![git clone](./img/11.%20git%20clone%20.png)



## Step 12 

> After cloning the Git repository, I updated the Apache HTTP server on my EC2 instance to enable it to host the MarketPeak e-commerce site.

Using the command:
sudo yum update -y





![sudo yum](./img/12.sudo%20yum%20update%20-y.png)



## Step 13 

> After updating the Apache HTTP server, I installed the server to ensure itâ€™s ready for use.

Using the command:
sudo yum install httpd




![sudo yum update](./img/13.sudo%20yum%20install%20httpd.png)



## Step 14

> After updating and installing Apache, I configured the server and set up the web directory for the website.

Using the commands:
sudo rm -rf
sudo cp -r ~




![sudo rm cp sudo systemctl](./img/13.sudo%20rm%20cp%20sudo%20systemctl.png)


## Step 15

> Finally, the Apache web server is ready to serve the website. However, I needed to reload the HTTP service for it to work properly.

Using the command:
sudo systemctl reload httpd

![sudo yum install http](./img/13.sudo%20yum%20install%20httpd.png)
